## Building and Running Instructions

Solution is going to implement in React with redux. Unit testing JEST and little bit style to look prettier.
Applications is fully focused on front-end architectural way with React Redux Saga and reusability of the components and taking care of when to fetch service and how to manage store. If we want to expand this application we can by creating more components like 'cars' inside apps folder, as an example I put an empty folder 'other-app' inside apps.

## Before running app, ensure that port 8080 is free

Go into repo root and run:

`npm i`

`npm start`
